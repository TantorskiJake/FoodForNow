  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the Ribs: Season the short ribs generously with salt and pepper.",
    "Sear the Ribs: Heat olive oil in a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the short ribs on all sides until browned. Remove and set aside.",
    "Cook the Veggies: In the same pot, add chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.",
    "Deglaze and Braise: Pour in the red wine (or beef broth) to deglaze the pot, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom. Return the short ribs to the pot, add the beef broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C). Braise for 2.5-3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.",
    "Finish with Pesto: Once the short ribs are done, remove them from the oven. Just before serving, spoon a bit of the store-bought pesto over the top of the ribs for added flavor.",
    "Cook the Onions for Risotto: In a separate pot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent.",
    "Add Rice and Wine for Risotto: Stir in the Arborio rice, coating it with the butter and onions. Pour in the white wine, stirring until absorbed.",
    "Cook the Risotto: Add the warm broth one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently. Allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. If using saffron, add it to the broth early on so it has time to infuse the rice.",
    "Finish the Risotto: Once the rice is creamy and cooked to your desired doneness (about 18-20 minutes), stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Serve: Spoon the risotto onto plates, place a braised short rib on top, and drizzle with more pesto if desired."
