  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).",
    "Prepare the Chicken: Season the chicken breasts generously with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large oven-safe skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Place the chicken breasts skin-side down in the skillet. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Flip the chicken over.",
    "Add Garlic, Rosemary, and Artichokes: Add the minced garlic, fresh rosemary, and artichoke hearts to the skillet. Sauté for about 2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant.",
    "Roast in the Oven: Pour in the chicken broth and add the butter to the skillet. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).",
    "Prepare the Salad: While the chicken is roasting, prepare the lemony arugula salad. In a large bowl, whisk together the fresh lemon juice and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the arugula and toss to coat. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese.",
    "Serve: Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Slice the chicken and serve it alongside the roasted artichokes, with a wedge of lemon for squeezing over the top. Plate the lemony arugula salad next to the chicken. Enjoy!"
