  "instructions": [
    "Cook the Capellini: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the capellini and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.",
    "Sauté the Shrimp: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the shrimp, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside.",
    "Prepare the Sauce: In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the capers, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes.",
    "Pour in the white wine and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the mixture to simmer and reduce slightly, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add the lemon zest and butter, stirring until the butter is melted and the sauce is smooth.",
    "Combine and Toss: Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet, tossing them in the sauce to coat evenly. Add the cooked capellini to the skillet, tossing to combine. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.",
    "Stir in the chopped parsley and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Serve: Divide the shrimp and pasta among plates. Garnish with extra parsley and lemon slices, if desired. Serve immediately, with extra lemon wedges on the side for a fresh squeeze."
