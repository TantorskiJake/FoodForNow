## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FoodForNow.git
   cd FoodForNow
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd foodfornow-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../foodfornow-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `foodfornow-backend` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=3001
     CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
     ```

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd foodfornow-backend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   cd foodfornow-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## Building and Running

To create a production build of the frontend run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the built files locally with Vite:

```bash
npm run preview -w foodfornow-frontend
```

Start the backend separately:

```bash
npm run start
```

React `StrictMode` in `src/main.jsx` is enabled only when `import.meta.env.DEV` is `true`.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- `src/`: Contains all frontend source code
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `pages/`: Page components
  - `services/`: API service for backend communication
  - `App.jsx`: Main application component
  - `index.jsx`: Entry point

### Backend
- `src/`: Contains all backend source code
  - `routes/`: API routes
  - `models/`: MongoDB models
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware (e.g., authentication)
  - `server.js`: Main server file

## Navbar Component

The Navbar component (`src/components/Navbar.jsx`) is a crucial part of the application's user interface. It provides navigation links and user authentication controls.

### Features
- **Conditional Rendering**: The Navbar is hidden on the login and registration pages.
- **Authentication**: Shows different options based on user authentication status.
- **Navigation Links**: Provides quick access to Dashboard, Pantry, Ingredients, Recipes, and Shopping List.
- **User Menu**: Displays a dropdown menu for user actions (e.g., logout).

### Usage
The Navbar is automatically rendered in the `App.jsx` file. It checks the user's authentication status and displays the appropriate navigation options.
